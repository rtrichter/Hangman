Hangman by Ryan Richter

Based on the classic game
This is a text only based version of hangman
In place of the hanging man there is a guess counter that can be manipulated.
The counter can have any number of guesses to make the game near impossible or childs play

To run in another file use the one of the following scripts

import hangman
hangman.run_game()

### OR

from hangman import run_game
run_game()

Everything above is also explained in the source code

NOTE:
I am new to programming and would really appreciate any revisions to my code
Feel free to let me know what you think and how you would do it better

Also I am aware that single player is currently broken i am working on fixing it
